# PC-instruments
Instruments for PC written in python

  One day I found that my home PC on windows does not have some tools which I needed. Some essentials. So I started this project
  
What I did:
- [x] Brightness control over each/all monitors
- [x] Time tools (stopwatch, timer)

What I want to do:
- [ ] Audio Memo, pass video or audio, recognise speech by people, create summary of it (Some AI work maybe?)
